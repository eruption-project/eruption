## Experimental Features

- Mouse support was added in version `0.1.10`. It can be enabled in `eruption.conf` by setting `"grab_mouse = true"` in section `[global]`. This will enable support for mouse events and Easy Shift+ mouse button macros.

- Eruption `0.1.12` somewhat relaxed the mouse grabbing mode. It now is possible for Eruption to process mouse events without grabbing the mouse exclusively. Injection of mouse events wont work in that mode though. This feature has been added to support setups, where another software should be granted exclusive access to the mouse device.

## Configuration and Usage

### Eruption configuration file

> You may want to try the
> [Eruption Profile Switcher](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2621/eruption-profile-switcher/)
> GNOME Shell extension, for easy switching of profiles on the fly.

The eruption configuration file `/etc/eruption/eruption.conf`:

```toml
# Eruption - Realtime RGB LED Driver for Linux
# Main configuration file

[global]
enable_experimental_features = false
driver_maturity_level = "testing"

profile_dirs = ["/var/lib/eruption/profiles/"]
script_dirs = ["/usr/share/eruption/scripts/"]

# select your keyboard variant
# keyboard_variant = "ANSI"
keyboard_variant = "ISO"

# Mouse handling
enable_mouse = true
grab_mouse = true

# "Away from keyboard" handling
afk_profile = "/var/lib/eruption/profiles/rainbow-wave.profile"
afk_timeout_secs = 0

# [[devices]]
# entry_type = "device"
# device_class = "serial"
# device_name = "Adalight Custom Serial LEDs"
# device_file = "/dev/ttyACM0"

# [[devices]]
# entry_type = "blacklist"
# vendor_id = 0x1e7d
# product_id = 0x311a
```

#### Section [global]

_enable_experimental_features_ = Enable experimental (unstable) features

_driver_maturity_level_ = Allow drivers with this maturity levels: "stable", "testing", "experimental"

_keyboard_variant_ = Switch between sub-variants of your device. (Only partially supported)

_enable_mouse_ = Enable support for mouse events. This will allow Eruption to react on mouse events.

_grab_mouse_ = Enable support for the injection of mouse events. This will allow Eruption to extend the Easy Shift+ macros to the mouse. Since the mouse is grabbed exclusively, other software will be prohibited from using the hardware mouse. Set this to `false` if you want Eruption to co-exist with other software, that needs to listen to mouse events, such as 3rd party device drivers.

### Profiles

The file `default.profile` from the directory `/var/lib/eruption/profiles`

```toml
id = '5dc62fa6-e965-45cb-a0da-e87d29713093'
name = 'Organic FX'
description = 'Organic effects'
active_scripts = [
      'organic.lua',
      'shockwave.lua',
  #   'impact.lua',
  #   'water.lua',
  #   'raindrops.lua',
      'macros.lua',
  #   'stats.lua',
]
```

The file `preset-red-yellow.profile` from the directory `/var/lib/eruption/profiles`

```toml
id = '5dc62fa6-e965-45cb-a0da-e87d29713099'
name = 'Preset: Red and Yellow'
description = '''Presets for a 'red and yellow' color scheme'''
active_scripts = [
   'batique.lua',
   'shockwave.lua',
    'macros.lua',
#   'stats.lua',
]

[[config.Batique]]
type = 'float'
name = 'color_divisor'
value = 2.0

[[config.Batique]]
type = 'float'
name = 'color_offset'
value = -90.0
```

This will run the `batique.lua` script to "paint the background", and on top of
that, display the shockwave effect from `shockwave.lua` when a key has been
pressed. Configuration values may be overridden on a per-profile basis. If a
configuration value is not listed in the `.profile` file, the default value
will be taken from the script's `.manifest` file.

#### Switching profiles and slots at runtime

> You may want to install the GNOME Shell extension
> [Eruption Profile Switcher](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/2621/eruption-profile-switcher/)
> or visit the [Github page](https://github.com/X3n0m0rph59/eruption-profile-switcher)

You may switch the currently active slot to `profile1.profile` with the following command:

##### Switch Profile

```shell
eruptionctl switch profile /var/lib/eruption/profiles/profile1.profile
```

##### Switch Slot

Slots can be switched with the following command:

**Switch to slot 2:**

```shell
eruptionctl switch slot 2
```

### Lua Scripts and Manifests

All script files and their corresponding manifests reside in the directory
`/usr/share/eruption/scripts`. You may use the provided scripts as a starting
point to write your own effects.

### Support for Macros

Eruption 0.1.1 added the infrastructure to support injection of keystrokes
(to support "macros").

This is achieved by adding a "virtual keyboard" to the system that injects
keystroke sequences as needed. The "real hardware" keyboard will be grabbed
exclusively on startup of the daemon. This allows Eruption to filter out
keystrokes, so they won't be reported to the system twice.

Eruption 0.1.8 introduced support for dynamic switching of slots via `MODIFIER + F1-F4` keys.

NOTE: `MODIFIER` is a placeholder for the modifier key. It is set to the **`FN`** key by default,
but can be re-mapped easily to e.g. the `Right Shift` or `Right Alt` keys.

Eruption 0.1.8 also added support for the macro keys (`Insert` - `Pagedown`) in conjunction with the
aforementioned `MODIFIER` key. So if you want to play back `Macro #1` you just have to press
`MODIFIER` + `[M1]` key.

Eruption 0.1.9 introduced the file `/usr/share/eruption/scripts/lib/macros/user-macros.lua`.
You may use it to implement your own macros.

Eruption 0.1.10 introduced _experimental_ mouse support. The mouse support is roughly implemented in the same way as the previously mentioned keyboard support, by adding a "virtual mouse" device to the system that injects events as needed. The "real hardware" mouse will be grabbed exclusively (this can be disabled) on startup of the daemon. This allows Eruption to filter out or inject "virtual" mouse events.

Scripts are combined to so called "effect pipelines" using a `.profile` file. E.g.: You may use one or more backgrounds, and then stack multiple
effects scripts on top of that.

## Available Macro Definitions

The macro files are stored in `/usr/share/eruption/scripts/lib/macros/`. Each file provides the Lua code that controls illumination and colors of each of the modifier layers, additionally they provide the code that gets executed when a macro key or Easy Shift shortcut is pressed. Eruption currently ships with custom keyboard macros for the following software:

| Name         | Class   | File              | Progress        | Description                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user-macros  | Default | `user-macros.lua` | Approx 95% done | Customizable general purpose macro definitions for Eruption. Maybe use this as a starting point for your own macro files. |

## Process Monitor

Eruption `0.1.17` added a new daemon called `eruption-process-monitor`, which allows for dynamic switching of profiles and slots using a rule matching engine.

## Effects Proxy Daemon

Eruption `0.3.0` added a new daemon called `eruption-fx-proxy`, that supersedes some functionality of `eruption-netfx`. It provides a more efficient and more
robust implementation of the `Ambient Effect`.
