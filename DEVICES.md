## Known Issues and Remarks

- You may want to set a different profile for each slot (`F1`-`F4`).
- Some keyboards may get into an inconsistent state when Eruption terminates while `Game Mode` is enabled. The state may be fixed manually or by a reboot/device hotplug

## Enabling `experimental` drivers

Experimental drivers are `disabled` in the default configuration!

To enable support for experimental drivers, please edit `/etc/eruption/eruption.conf` and set
```toml
driver_maturity_level = "experimental"
```

After that, please restart the eruption daemon

```shell
sudo systemctl restart eruption.service
```

## ROCCAT Vulcan 100/12x series keyboard

### Support status

Fully supported

### Remarks and known Issues

- Mute button will stay lit even if audio is muted
- The default `MODIFIER` key is the **`FN`** key. Use it to switch slots (with `F1-F4`) or execute macros (`M1-M6`).
- Use the `FN` key to access special function keys (`F5`-`F8`)
- Use the `FN` key to access media functions (`F9`-`F12`)
- Easy Shift+ may be activated by pressing `FN`+`Scroll Lock/GameMode` and then `CAPS LOCK`.

## ROCCAT Vulcan Pro TKL series keyboard

### Support status

Nearly fully supported, as of `0.1.19`

### Remarks and known Issues

- The default `MODIFIER` key is the **`FN`** key. Use it to switch slots (with `F1-F4`).
- Slots may currently only be switched via `FN` + `F1-F4`, switching via `FN + LEFT` or `FN + RIGHT` causes problems
- Neighbor topology tables are currently not fully correct, this may lead to mis-rendering of some effects
- You can use the `FN` key to access special function keys (`F5`-`F8`) (*inofficial) like on the ROCCAT Vulcan Pro / ROCCAT Vulcan 100/12x
- Use the `FN` key too to access media functions (`F9`-`F12`)
- Easy Shift+ may be activated by pressing `FN`+`Page Down/GameMode` and then `CAPS LOCK`.

## ROCCAT Vulcan TKL series keyboard

### Support status

Work-in-progress, completely untested, as of `0.1.20`.

### Remarks and known Issues

- The default `MODIFIER` key is the **`FN`** key. Use it to switch slots (with `F1-F4`).
- Slots may currently only be switched via `FN` + `F1-F4`, switching via `FN + LEFT` or `FN + RIGHT` causes problems
- Neighbor topology tables are currently not fully correct, this may lead to mis-rendering of some effects

Work-in-progress, completely untested. Probably not working, as of `0.1.20`

### Remarks and known Issues

- Mute button will stay lit even if audio is muted
- The default `MODIFIER` key is the **`FN`** key. Use it to switch slots (with `F1-F4`) or execute macros (`M1-M6`).
- Use the `FN` key to access special function keys (`F5`-`F8`)
- Use the `FN` key to access media functions (`F9`-`F12`)
- Easy Shift+ may be activated by pressing `FN`+`Scroll Lock/GameMode` and then `CAPS LOCK`.

## ROCCAT Magma

### Support status

Work-in-progress as of `0.1.23`

### Remarks and known Issues
