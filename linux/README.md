## Linux Kernel Modules

**This is all very much a work in progress (WIP)**

All Eruption Linux kernel modules are completely optional, their usage is not required for Eruption to work.

You will need a Kernel that supports the current stable version of Rust (Linux >= 6.1)

### eruption-blackout

Turn off the LEDs of supported devices, and wait for the Eruption daemon to take over from userspace
