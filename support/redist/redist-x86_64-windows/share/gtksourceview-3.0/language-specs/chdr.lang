    We include C++ and ObjC contexts since the .h extension
    is also used for those languages. If you use .hh
    or similar, we will use cpphdr.lang which is
    basically the same thing, but having a separate lang file
    allows a program to apply a language specific behavior,
    for instance a different style for C++ headers.
