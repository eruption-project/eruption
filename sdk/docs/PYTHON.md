## Using the Python SDK

### Getting started

First you need to set up the required environment:

- Create a virtual environment (venv)
- Install the dependencies
  - Eruption Python 3 SDK
  - Google Protocol Buffers
- Run an example application to test the installation
  - `simple.py` located in `sdk/examples/python/`

### Installation Instructions

Create the virtual environment (venv)

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now install the dependencies

```shell
pip install eruption-sdk
```

### Example Code

#### Imports

```python
from eruption import SDK_VERSION, Connection, Canvas, Color
```

#### Establishing a Connection

The following code will establish a connection to a running instance of Eruption via the
local transport (UNIX domain socket)

```python
    # connect to the Eruption daemon (via a local connection)
    try:
        print("Connecting to the Eruption daemon...")
        connection = Connection(type=Connection.LOCAL)

        connection.connect()
        print("Successfully connected to the Eruption daemon")

        status = connection.get_server_status()
        print(status)
```

#### Switching Profiles

The current active profile file can be queried using `get_active_profile()` and set using `switch_profile()`.

```python
    print("Currently using", connection.get_active_profile())
```

```python
    # Use the profile's full file path
    connection.switch_profile("/var/lib/eruption/profiles/solid.profile")
```

#### Updating Parameters

One or more script parameters can be set using `set_parameters()`. Pass in the full file
path of the profile and the script, then any parameters you want to update.

```python
    profile_file = "/var/lib/eruption/profiles/solid.profile"
    script_file = "/usr/share/eruption/scripts/solid.lua"
    connection.set_parameters(profile_file, script_file, color_background="#ff3f00ff", opacity=0.9)
```

#### Controlling the Canvas

Using the canvas with the Color class

```python
        # create a new canvas
        canvas = Canvas()

        red = Color(255, 0, 0, 128)
        green = Color(0, 255, 0, 128)
        blue = Color(0, 0, 255, 128)
        final = Color(0, 0, 0, 0)

        canvas.fill(red)
        print("Submitting canvas...")
        connection.submit_canvas(canvas)

        time.sleep(1)

        canvas.fill(green)

        print("Submitting canvas...")
        connection.submit_canvas(canvas)

        time.sleep(1)

        canvas.fill(blue)
        print("Submitting canvas...")
        connection.submit_canvas(canvas)

        time.sleep(1)

        canvas.fill(final)
        print("Submitting canvas...")
        connection.submit_canvas(canvas)
```

#### Terminating the Connection

```python
        connection.disconnect()
        print("Exiting now")

    except (Exception) as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {type(e).__name__} {e}" )
```

#### Full Code Listing

```python
import sys
import time

from eruption import SDK_VERSION, Connection, Canvas, Color

EXAMPLE_NAME = "Simple Python Example #1"

def main():
    """Main program entrypoint"""

    print(f"Welcome to the Eruption SDK!\nYou are running the \"{EXAMPLE_NAME}\" "
          f"from the Eruption SDK version {SDK_VERSION}\n")

    # connect to the Eruption daemon (via a local connection)
    try:
        print("Connecting to the Eruption daemon...")
        connection = Connection(type=Connection.LOCAL)

        connection.connect()
        print("Successfully connected to the Eruption daemon")

        status = connection.get_server_status()
        print(status)

        # create a new canvas
        canvas = Canvas()

        red = Color(255, 0, 0, 128)
        green = Color(0, 255, 0, 128)
        blue = Color(0, 0, 255, 128)
        final = Color(0, 0, 0, 0)

        canvas.fill(red)
        print("Submitting canvas...")
        connection.submit_canvas(canvas)

        time.sleep(1)

        canvas.fill(green)

        print("Submitting canvas...")
        connection.submit_canvas(canvas)

        time.sleep(1)

        canvas.fill(blue)
        print("Submitting canvas...")
        connection.submit_canvas(canvas)

        time.sleep(1)

        canvas.fill(final)
        print("Submitting canvas...")
        connection.submit_canvas(canvas)

        connection.disconnect()
        print("Exiting now")

    except (Exception) as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {type(e).__name__} {e}" )


if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        main()
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        pass
